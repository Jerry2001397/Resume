        <h1>Statement of Motivation</h1>
Since my final year the Brighter Day High School, I have been fascinated by the workings of 
computers—their logic, and limitless potential to transform data into information 
for human understanding. This deep passion for computing has driven my 
academic journey and shaped my decision to pursue a degree in Information
Technology, with a special emphasis on Data Science.
<br>
<br>
Before my enrollment at the University of Liberia—UL, I mustered the courage to 
support myself in a computer training school, where I had basic understating of 
computer and other tech related courses. Throughout my studies, I have been 
captivated by how data can reveal patterns, drive decisions, and solve real-world 
problems. <br>
I am energized by the challenge of turning raw data into meaningful 
information. My coursework in statistics, algorithms, and data mining has not only 
strengthened my technical skills but also deepened my curiosity about the evergrowing role of data in today’s digital world.
What excites me most about Data Science is its multidisciplinary nature—
combining computer science, mathematics, and domain knowledge to derive 
actionable insights. 
<br>
<br>
I am particularly interested in areas such as predictive 
analytics, Machine Learning, natural language processing, and data-driven decision making. I see 
these tools not just as technologies, but as means to make impactful contributions 
in sectors like healthcare, education, and sustainable development.
<br>
<br>
Outside the classroom, I have undertaken personal projects and online courses to 
deepen my skills in python, JavaScript, SQL, Excel, and data visualization tools. These experiences 
have reinforced my commitment to continuous learning and innovation. I am eager 
to apply and expand this knowledge in practical environments, through internships, 
collaborative research and advanced study.
<br>
<br>
My long-term goal is to become a Data scientist who will not only excels in technical 
expertise but also understands the ethical and societal implications of data use. I 
am driven by a desire to build intelligent systems that are both efficient and 
responsible. My passion for computers, combined with a growing proficiency in 
Data science, motivates me to pursue further opportunities that challenge my 
thinking and push the boundaries of what technology can achieve.
